Primitive Metal (working title)

I. High Concept
It's "Just Shapes and Beats" but with a "Touhou" level of dodging (many projectiles, tiny character hitbox, very precise movements).

II. Genre
The game is a very fast-paced, action bullet hell game.

III. Platform
It's going to be desktop only, as it would require a keyboard.

IV. Story
This game doesn't necessarily have a story, as it is more focussed on the gameplay. The mood will be dependant on whatever song is playing, but it is likely to be on the darker side. The player will progress to the next level after beating the current "boss", and the player's goal is to get through all of the levels. A boss rush of sorts.

V. Esthetics
The graphical style of the game is abstract. Most of the enemies/bullets/objects will be primitive shapes, with various colors matching the theme. The music is going to be EDM or power metal, and the waves of bullets/objects will correspond to the song itself. Otherwise, the game doesn't need any other sounds (except minor stuff like a game over tune).

VI. Gameplay
The mechanics of the game are straight forward: the player moves in 2D around the screen, avoiding bullets until the time runs out/the song ends. One of the key reasons why a player would play is pride, as the game will be pretty challenging. And when something is challenging, and not all too tedious, people will play it.
The character is controlled using a keyboard. Nothing else (unless controller is a feasible option).
The player is taught by the first level, which will be much easier than the rest. There may be some popups explaining the controls, but the user has a chance to get used to the controls with the first level.
Strictly speaking, the player needs to learn how to react to the various bullets without focussing on their own character. They need to be able to implicitly determine where there character is, and focus on the obstacles ahead (this is quite common in most challenging games).
